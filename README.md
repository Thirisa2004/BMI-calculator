A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to assess an individual's body composition based on their height and weight. It provides a numerical value indicating whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese according to standard ranges. The calculation involves dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. BMI calculators serve as a simple and widely used method for estimating body fat and assessing potential health risks associated with weight status. They are commonly utilized in healthcare settings, fitness facilities, and by individuals monitoring their own health. However, it's important to note that BMI is a screening tool and does not directly measure body fat percentage or account for factors like muscle mass, bone density, or distribution of fat, so it may not always accurately reflect an individual's overall health or fitness level.
